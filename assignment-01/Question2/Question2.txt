A. There are 2 to the nth power possible functions that can describe a boolean decision with n boolean feature. In this case there are four features but not all are boolean. Two features are boolean, one feature has three possible outcome, and one feature has four possible outcomes. Thus in this case there are 2 * 2 * 3 * 4 possible functions (two options for first two features, three for third four for fourth) thus 48 total possible functions.
